  /*
  Three promise states:
  - pending: async is not completed yet
  - completed: async is completed
    - fulfilled: promise is fulfilled with expected return type
    - rejected: error thrown in async function

  Promise callbacks scheduled on microtask queue (exists right before the event loop)
  - Event loop has pending call backs phase (macrotask longer running callbacks)

  When promise returned
  - associated callback in .then() added to microtask queue
  - In event loop, the microtask runs between/before event loop tasks
  - Main thread - sync; event loop is inf loop in main thread to manage async functionality
